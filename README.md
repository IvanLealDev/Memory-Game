## Description
> This page is a memory game in which players must find pairs of identical cards. 

> It uses <i>HTML</i>, <i>CSS</i>, and <i>JavaScript</i> for its development, providing an attractive and dynamic visual interface. 

> The design is based on a blurred background and a dynamically generated game board with <i>JavaScript</i>. 

> Cards are randomly shuffled each time they are played and rotate with an animation when selected. 

> It also features a reset button that allows players to restart the game without reloading the page. <i>JavaScript</i> handles the game logic, user interaction, and the card matching system.
